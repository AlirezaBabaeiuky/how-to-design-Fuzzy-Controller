There are multiple ways to design a fuzzy controller in Simulink. Here are a few commonly used methods:

Design the fuzzy system externally and load it into Simulink:

Use the Fuzzy Logic Designer app or command-line functions to design the fuzzy system and save it as a .fis file.
Load the .fis file into the MATLAB workspace using the load function.
In Simulink, use the Fuzzy Logic Controller block and specify the name of the loaded fuzzy system in the block's parameters.
Design the fuzzy system directly within Simulink:

Use the Fuzzy Logic Designer block in Simulink to design the fuzzy system.
Configure the membership functions, fuzzy rules, and input/output variables within the block.
Customize the block's parameters according to your specific fuzzy system requirements.
Both methods allow you to design and use fuzzy controllers in Simulink. 
The first method provides flexibility by allowing you to design the fuzzy system outside of Simulink and load it as needed. The second method offers a more integrated approach, enabling you to design the fuzzy system directly within the Simulink environment.
